SUBJECT: Q4 2025 Highlight Report: Program Development & Strategic Partnerships

Dear Director,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to share a comprehensive highlight report documenting my contributions to Man Up! Inc. from September through December 2025, with particular emphasis on initiatives that position our organization for expanded impact in 2026.

As you know, my approach to this work emphasizes strategic autonomy and results-driven execution. While I understand there may be concerns about my time on-site, I believe the attached report demonstrates that our investment in community-embedded work, inter-agency relationship building, and technical infrastructure development has yielded measurable returns that extend well beyond traditional office-based activities.

The attached highlight report details:

• Technical Infrastructure: Development of fully functional Fatherhood Initiative and Sisterhood Initiative web platforms with participant databases, ready for integration with Manupinc.org

• Community Impact: Successful mobilization of 100+ participants at Million Man March Anniversary, distribution of emergency resources to 70+ community members during Thanksgiving Drive, and proactive case management yielding documented behavioral improvements in high-need youth

• Strategic Partnerships: Cultivation of collaborative relationships with NYU Prison Education Program, NYU Center for Urban Science + Progress, KAVI Data Team, City Council Data Team, Office of the Public Advocate, DYCD, SCO, RISE, and Brooklyn Defender Services

• Programmatic Innovation: Complete curriculum restructuring for Boys Club, implementation of low-intensity case management protocols, and development of "The Algorithm of Interruption" mini-hackathon scheduled for January 28th at NYU

• Pipeline Development: Secured commitment from Microsoft GitHub Software Engineer Sneha Kripanandan for a four-part intro to CS workshop series available free to MUI staff and community participants

I have also taken initiative to build similar technical tools for other departments and have been in discussions with Brother Shoebi regarding multi-departmental dashboard development. My work on SafeStep—a pedestrian safety navigation app inspired by community-led safety initiatives—has direct applications to our violence interruption methodology and will be explored further during the upcoming hackathon.

The strategic value of this work lies not just in deliverables, but in the relationships cultivated, the institutional knowledge developed, and the pathways created for organizational growth. My commitment is to Man Up! Inc.'s mission, and I believe the most effective execution of that mission sometimes requires presence in community spaces, partner institutions, and technical environments rather than exclusively on-site.

I welcome the opportunity to discuss these initiatives in greater detail and to explore how we can align operational expectations with the strategic imperatives that drive this work forward.

Respectfully submitted,

Aunray Stanford
