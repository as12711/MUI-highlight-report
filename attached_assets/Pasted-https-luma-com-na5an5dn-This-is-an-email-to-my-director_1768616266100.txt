https://luma.com/na5an5dn        This is an email to my director with a highlight report (She's stirring fuss from the top down and trying to have me micro-managed, because I basically over-deliver and don't stay on site but atlas--) : image 1-3 Fatherhood Initiative Sign Up / database for participant data management (I have also taken initiative to create a similar webpage and database for CDT ' s Sisterhood initiative / and have discussed assisting Brother Shoebi in Tech with creating dashboards and database for multi-departmental use). All features are fully ready for integration with Manupinc.org the orgs existing namesake site ; image 4 is a group photo from 11/26 in the Prince Joshua Avitto Community Center (PJACC). I organized 12 community volunteers to host a Thanksgiving kickback - We serviced close to 100 *more like 70* community members with hot food, gently used clothes and footwear, and donated the leftovers at 645 Van Siclen Samaritan Village ; image 5 The Mini Hackathon is a collaboration between MUI and NYU to introduce the idea of CMS inspired tech solutions in public safety, with AT speaking. I aspire for this to create an ongoing relationship between Man Up and larger academic entity and to create a pipeline for our interest. This is connected to a much bigger 3day event I'm helping to organize for the Spring (PIT-UN Tech for Change Hackathon - where MUI is positioned to work with Universities, City Council, Public Advocates Office, and really countless partners to innovate public safety). With your connection, Dr Divine Pryor (her husband) and I had an enlightening / productive conversation (we happen to share overlapping networks at NYU ' s Prison Education Program (PEP), which he pioneered) about potential next-steps to expanding Incredible Messenger University (IMU) - and I'm the calendar to progress the discussion with NYU PEP ' s Executive Director AT Mitchell - Mann; upload 6 Doc emphasis on Sept 2025 onward (as that's when myself and Brother Burney were tasked with revitalizing a dead department - I led every last achievement including the providing of holistic mentorship or "low intensive case management" advocating for our higher risk boys in schools, against ACS, and providing safe spaces as you'll see - a direct request from AT to show up in their schools, homes, hobbies, to integrate Man Up and our peace mantras into every part of their lives) ; image 7 New Fatherhood material from the media & arts department that utilizes the QR leading to our new sign up system ; upload 8 and 9 As requested by Exec AT Mitchell - full restructuring of Boys Club Curriculum , and updated Participant permission slips / waiver agreement (with legalese that protects the org from liability) ; image 10 SafeStep demo https://safestep-demo.surge.sh/app.html (maybe conflate with Hackathon stuff) is an app inspired by "Canvassing" and Community led safety initiatives that I'm building  (that we will explore more during the Mini Hackathon) -- ** The email should preface a doc that reads like butter and integrates the imagery, links, etc. , a smooth timeline narrative - PARTNERSHIPS LIAISED : NYU Prison Education Program, NYU Center for Urban Science and Progress, KAVI Data Team, City Council Data Team, Public Advocates Office , NY Peace Org. Still building rapport with : Innovating Justice, Fortune Society. NEXT UP : I have a commitment from MICROSOFT GITHUB Software Engineer Sneha Kripanandan to facilitate a four-part intro to CS available for free to our staff and suitable community participants. Currently working on logistics and promo materials with media and Arts department.
